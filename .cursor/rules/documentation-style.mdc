# Documentation Style Guidelines

## Overview

Follow these guidelines for all documentation in the project to ensure clean, readable, and consistent documentation.

## Core Principles

- No bold or italic formatting - use plain text only
- Prefer bullet points and numbered lists over paragraphs
- Keep content brief but precise and clean
- Write in clear, direct language without excessive formatting
- Focus on substance over style - let the content speak for itself
- Use headings and clear structure
- Shorter sentences are better than longer sentences
- Bullet points are better than paragraphs
- Minimize code examples since we work inside the codebase
- Assume reader is aware of project context

## Writing Style

### Good Examples

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD - Clean, natural writing

User can upload product images through the admin interface.
The system validates file format and size before processing.

Configuration files are stored in the functions/config directory.
Each supplier has its own mapping configuration.
```

### Avoid Examples

```markdown
# ❌ AVOID - Over-formatted text

**User** can upload _product images_ through the **admin interface**.
The system **validates** file format and size before **processing**.

Configuration files are stored in the `functions/config` directory.
Each supplier has its own mapping configuration.
```

## Structure Guidelines

- Use clear headings for sections
- Prefer lists over paragraphs
- Keep sections focused and concise
- Use numbered lists for sequential processes
- Use bullet points for related items

## Content Guidelines

- Assume reader understands project context
- Focus on what's unique or important
- Avoid redundant explanations
- Minimize code examples unless essential
- Prefer references to existing code over examples

## Application

Apply these guidelines to:
- PRD documents
- Technical documentation
- README files
- Configuration documentation
- Process descriptions
